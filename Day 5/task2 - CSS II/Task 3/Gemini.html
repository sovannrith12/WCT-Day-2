Sass: A Superset of CSS
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS by adding features like nesting, variables, mixins, and more. It offers a more efficient and organized way to write CSS.

Key Differences Between Sass and Regular CSS:

Nesting: In Sass, you can nest selectors within each other, improving code readability and organization.
Variables: Sass allows you to define variables for reusable values, making your CSS more maintainable.
Partials: You can create partial files (files with a .scss extension) that can be imported into other Sass files.
Mixins: Mixins are reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included in other stylesheets.
Example: Sass File
SCSS
// Variables
$primary-color: #007bff;
$font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

// Nesting
.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    background-color: darken($primary-color,   
 10%);
  }
}

// Partials
@import "partials/mixins";

// Using a mixin
.box {
  @include border-radius(5px);
}
Use code with caution.

Compiled CSS
CSS
.button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: #006ebf;   

}

.box {
  border-radius: 5px;
}
Use code with caution.

Notable Differences:

Nesting: The &:hover selector is nested within the .button selector, making the code more organized.
Variables: The $primary-color variable is used to define the button's background color.
Partials: The @import "partials/mixins"; directive imports a partial file containing mixins.
Mixins: The @include border-radius(5px); statement uses the border-radius mixin to apply rounded corners to the .box element.
As you can see, Sass provides a more concise and readable way to write CSS, especially for larger projects.
