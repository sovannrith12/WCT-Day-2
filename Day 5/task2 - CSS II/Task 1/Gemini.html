CSS Processors: A Brief Overview
A CSS processor is a tool that extends the capabilities of CSS by adding new features and syntax. These processors compile your CSS code into standard CSS that browsers can understand. They offer various advantages, including:

Nesting: Allows you to nest selectors within each other, improving code readability.
Variables: Enables you to define variables for reusable values, making your CSS more maintainable.
Mixins: Creates reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included in other stylesheets.
Functions: Provides built-in functions for complex calculations or manipulations.
Vendor Prefixes: Automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS properties for better browser compatibility.
Popular CSS Preprocessors
Sass: One of the most widely used preprocessors, known for its powerful features and large community.
Less: A mature preprocessor with a syntax similar to CSS.
Stylus: A highly expressive preprocessor with a minimalist syntax.
Advantages of Using a CSS Processor
Improved Readability: Nesting and variables make CSS code more organized and easier to understand.
Enhanced Maintainability: Reusable mixins and functions reduce code duplication and simplify updates.
Better Browser Compatibility: Automatic vendor prefixing ensures your styles work across different browsers.
Advanced Features: CSS processors offer additional features like calculations, color manipulation, and more.
Code Example: Sass
SCSS
// Sass code
$primary-color: #007bff;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer; Â  

}
Use code with caution.

The compiled CSS output would be:

CSS
.button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
Use code with caution.

As you can see, the CSS processor automatically expands the variable and removes the unnecessary nesting.
