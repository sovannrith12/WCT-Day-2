Variables, Functions, and Inheritance in Sass
Variables
Variables in Sass allow you to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheet. This makes it easier to maintain consistency and make global changes.

Example:

SCSS
$primary-color: #007bff;
$font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  font-family: $font-family;
}
Use code with caution.

Functions
Sass functions provide built-in functionality for common tasks like color manipulation, mathematical operations, and string manipulation.

Example:

SCSS
.dark-button {
  background-color: darken($primary-color, 20%);
  color: white;
}
Use code with caution.

In this example, the darken() function is used to create a darker shade of the $primary-color.

Inheritance
Sass supports inheritance through nesting. When a nested selector is defined within a parent selector, it inherits the properties of the parent.

Example:

SCSS
.container {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;

  .item {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 5px;
  }
}
Use code with caution.

In this example, the .item selector inherits the border: 1px solid #ccc; and padding: 10px; properties from its parent .container selector.

Benefits of Using Variables, Functions, and Inheritance:

Improved Readability: Variables and functions make your code more concise and easier to understand.
Enhanced Maintainability: By using variables and functions, you can centralize style definitions and make global changes more easily.
Increased Consistency: Inheritance helps ensure that styles are applied consistently across your website.
Better Performance: Using variables and functions can sometimes improve performance by reducing the number of CSS rules that need to be parsed.
