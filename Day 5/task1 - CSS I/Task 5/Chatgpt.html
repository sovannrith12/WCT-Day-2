Inline Styles in HTML
Inline styles are CSS properties applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute. This method allows you to quickly apply unique styling to individual elements without creating a separate stylesheet or writing multiple rules.

Example of an HTML Document with Inline Styles
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Inline Styles Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 36px; text-align: center;">Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: green; font-size: 18px;">
        This paragraph has an inline style applied directly to it. The text is styled in green, with a specific font and size.
    </p>

    <button style="background-color: orange; color: white; border: none; padding: 10px;">
        Click Me
    </button>

</body>
</html>
Explanation of the Inline Styles
Heading (<h1>):

color: blue; — Sets the text color of the heading to blue.
font-size: 36px; — Specifies the font size of the heading.
text-align: center; — Centers the heading text within the page.
Paragraph (<p>):

font-family: Arial, sans-serif; — Specifies the font used for the paragraph text.
color: green; — Sets the text color to green.
font-size: 18px; — Sets the font size of the paragraph to 18 pixels.
Button (<button>):

background-color: orange; — Sets the background color of the button to orange.
color: white; — Sets the text color of the button to white.
border: none; — Removes any borders around the button.
padding: 10px; — Adds padding around the button text for spacing.
Pros and Cons of Using Inline Styles
Pros:
Quick and Easy:

Inline styles are quick to apply since you only need to add the style attribute directly to an element.
Specific to One Element:

Inline styles are applied directly to individual elements, which makes them ideal for one-off changes where you don’t want to affect other elements.
No External File Needed:

You don’t need an external CSS file, making inline styles useful for small projects or specific, minor adjustments.
Cons:
Poor Maintainability:

Inline styles can clutter the HTML and make it difficult to maintain as your project grows, especially when applied to multiple elements.
Lack of Reusability:

Styles defined inline cannot be reused across multiple elements or pages. If you need the same style on multiple elements, you must apply it repeatedly.
Overcomplicates HTML:

Inline styles mix content with presentation, which violates the principle of separation of concerns. This can make your HTML more difficult to read and manage.
Harder to Override:

Inline styles have high specificity, which can make it difficult to override them with other styles (e.g., styles from an external or internal stylesheet).
