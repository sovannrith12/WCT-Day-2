Applying Styles Directly to HTML Elements
Using the style Attribute

You can apply styles directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute within the opening tag. The style attribute takes a CSS declaration as its value, which consists of a property-value pair separated by a colon.

Example HTML Document:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Inline Styles</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 36px;">This is a heading</h1>
    <p style="background-color: lightblue; font-family: Arial;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com" style="color: green; text-decoration: none;">Visit my website</a>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

The h1 element has the styles color: red; font-size: 36px; applied directly to it.
The p element has the styles background-color: lightblue; font-family: Arial; applied directly to it.
The a element has the styles color: green; text-decoration: none; applied directly to it.
Pros of Inline Styles:

Quick and easy: You can apply specific styles to individual elements without having to create a separate stylesheet.
Immediate effect: Changes made to inline styles are immediately reflected in the browser.
Cons of Inline Styles:

Poor maintainability: Inline styles can make your HTML code less readable and harder to maintain, especially for complex stylesheets.
Redundancy: If the same styles need to be applied to multiple elements, it can lead to redundant code.
Lack of reusability: Styles defined inline cannot be reused across multiple HTML documents.
Best Practices:

Use inline styles sparingly: For simple, one-off styles, inline styles can be convenient. However, for more complex or reusable styles, it's generally better to use external stylesheets.
Consider CSS classes: If you need to apply the same styles to multiple elements, create a CSS class and assign it to those elements. This will make your code more organized and maintainable.
