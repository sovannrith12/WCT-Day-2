Online Fonts and Favicons
Online Fonts
Online fonts are fonts that are hosted on external servers and can be accessed and used on websites without needing to be downloaded and installed locally. This offers a wider variety of fonts and can improve cross-browser compatibility.

Using Google Fonts

Google Fonts is a popular service that provides a vast library of free fonts. To use Google Fonts in an HTML document, follow these steps:

Choose Fonts: Visit the Google Fonts website (fonts.google.com) and select the fonts you want to use.
Embed Code: Click the "Embed" button and copy the generated HTML code.
Add to Your HTML: Paste the embedded code into the <head> section of your HTML document.
Example:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link Â  
 href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    </body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Favicons
A favicon is a small image that appears in the browser's tab or address bar, representing your website. It helps users identify your site and can improve brand recognition.

Adding a Favicon

Create a Favicon: Create a square image (typically 16x16 or 32x32 pixels) in a format like PNG or ICO.
Add to Your HTML: Place the favicon image in your website's directory and add the following code to the <head> section of your HTML document:
HTML
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="path/to/your/favicon.ico">
Use code with caution.

Example:

HTML
<head>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon.ico">
</head>
Use code with caution.

By using online fonts and favicons, you can enhance the visual appeal and branding of your website.
