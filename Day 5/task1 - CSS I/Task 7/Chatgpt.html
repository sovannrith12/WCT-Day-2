Online Fonts and Favicon in Web Development
Online fonts (also known as web fonts) are fonts that are not installed on the user's device but are loaded from a web server when a web page is accessed. This allows developers to use unique, custom fonts that might not be available by default on all devices.

Google Fonts is one of the most popular resources for free and open-source web fonts. Using Google Fonts, you can easily integrate a variety of custom fonts into your website.

A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small icon displayed in a browser's tab, bookmarks, or address bar. It's a way to visually represent your website.

How to Use Google Fonts in an HTML Document
Go to Google Fonts.
Choose a font you like.
Copy the <link> provided by Google to include the font in your HTML document.
Use the font in your CSS.
Example Using Google Fonts:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Using Google Fonts and Favicon</title>
    
    <!-- Step 3: Link to Google Fonts -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&family=Lobster&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    
    <!-- Step 6: Add Favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">
    
    <style>
        /* Step 4: Apply Google Fonts */
        body {
            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
            font-size: 18px;
            color: #333;
        }

        h1 {
            font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;
            color: #ff5722;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>
        This page is styled using Google Fonts. The body text uses the 'Roboto' font, while the heading uses the 'Lobster' font. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A favicon has also been added to the page. It will show up in the browser tab.
    </p>

</body>
</html>
Explanation:
Google Fonts:

Linking the Font:
The <link> tag imports the desired fonts from Google Fonts. In this case, weâ€™re using both the Roboto and Lobster fonts.
The wght@400;700 indicates that we are importing two font weights: regular (400) and bold (700).
Using the Font in CSS:
The font-family property in the body element applies the Roboto font to all text on the page.
The h1 tag uses Lobster, a decorative cursive font.
Favicon:

The <link rel="icon" href="favicon.png"> tag references a favicon file, typically a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel .ico or .png image.
This image is displayed next to the title of the web page in the browser tab and bookmarks.
Advantages of Using Google Fonts:
Wide Variety: Google Fonts offers a huge collection of free fonts with different styles and weights.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Fonts from Google are optimized to work across all major browsers and devices.
Easy to Implement: You only need a simple <link> tag to use a font from Google Fonts.
What is a Favicon?
A favicon is a small, iconic image that represents your website. It appears in the browser tab, bookmarks, and other areas in the browser.

How to Add a Favicon:
You need an image file (usually .ico, .png, or .svg) for the favicon.
Use the <link> tag in the <head> of your HTML document to reference the image.
Example:
html
Copy code
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">
rel="icon" specifies that the file is the website's favicon.
type="image/png" defines the format of the favicon.
href="favicon.png" links to the favicon image file.
Conclusion:
Google Fonts: Easy-to-use, customizable fonts that enhance the aesthetics of your website.
Favicon: A small but essential element that visually identifies your website in a browser.
By combining both features, you improve the design and branding of your website, making it more user-friendly and professional.
