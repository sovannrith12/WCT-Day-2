CSS Selectors: Targeting Elements
CSS selectors are used to specify which HTML elements should be affected by CSS styles. They act as a way to identify and target specific elements within an HTML document.

Types of CSS Selectors
Element Selector: Targets elements based on their tag name.
Class Selector: Targets elements that have a specific class attribute.
ID Selector: Targets a single element with a unique ID attribute.
Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attributes.
Pseudo-Class Selector: Targets elements based on their state or condition.
