Flexbox: A Powerful Layout Tool
Flexbox is a CSS layout module that provides a flexible and efficient way to arrange items in a container. It's particularly useful for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

Key Concepts

Flex Axis: The main axis along which the flex items are arranged.
Cross Axis: The axis perpendicular to the flex axis.

Use code with caution.

Explanation
The container has display: flex; to make it a flex container.
flex-wrap: wrap; allows the items to wrap to the next line if there's not enough space.
The item elements have flex: 0 0 auto; to give them a default size and allow them to grow or shrink as needed.
The items are arranged horizontally with a margin between them.
This layout will adapt to different screen sizes, automatically adjusting the number of items per row based on the available space.
