            To understand how to create well designed websites, it is worth understanding the fundamentals of design.
            Good design creates experiences that makes people's lives easier, and is also aesthetically pleasing.
            Here are some examples: a well-designed store makes it easy for customers to fi nd products they are looking for, or maybe even products they never knew they wanted.
            Drivers can see well-designed road signs from a distance and the message of the sign can be immediately understood, even at a high rate of speed while driving.
            A welldesigned chair is comfortable to sit in and also fits in with the style of the room.
            <br><br>
            In all these cases, the designer took time to plan the outcome using their skill and experience, as well as resources such as materials and available budget.
            Diff erent disciplines require different design tools.
            The web designer is often required to organize information, give it meaning, and assemble it in a way that is visually attractive using available tools.
            When designing for the web, there are some unique challenges compared to other disciplines arising from the fact that web design is still in its infancy and is evolving rapidly.
            Even the definition of web design is evolving and difficult to define. Originally, web design meant designing pages for a web browser.
            While this is still true, you now need to consider the rapidly evolving nature of mobile devices, tablets, smart phones, and consumer electronics that access the web.
            Some people make the distinction between mobile design and web design, but this distinction is evaporating as mobile devices are evolving.
            For many web professionals, this rapid evolution of the medium is part of what makes it such an exciting field.
            Although the design of websites is an evolving fi eld, designers do not need to reinvent the wheel.
            Web design's closest relative is print design, and although the two are distinctly different it is worthwhile to compare and contrast them.

        <h2><a name="SelfStudyL1">Self Study</a></h2>
        <p>
            1 Using a paper and pencil, come up with your own version of how the SmoothieWorld site might be organized. Research popular recipe websites.
            <br>
            How do they organize their large collection of recipes?
            <br>
            2 Find a partner and conduct the usability test outlined earlier in this lesson.
            <br>
            What did you learn that you might apply to a site like SmoothieWorld?

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
            1 What is the diff erence between a wireframe, mockup, and prototype?
            <br>
            2 Defi ne information architecture.
            <br>
            3 What is usability testing and how does it relate to web design?
        </p>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
            1 A wireframe is a diagram or sketch of a web page that focuses on structure and layout, not visual elements such as color or graphics.
            A mockup is a visual representation of a page that includes font choices, colors, layout, and images.
            A prototype may contain elements of wireframes or mockups but is primarily concerned with demonstrating the interaction between a user and the site.
            <br>
            2 Information architecture is the process of organizing a website's content and defining the navigation of the site.
            <br>
            3 Usability testing is the procedure in which a user is given a task or series of tasks relating to a website, such as purchasing an item, and then asked to determine where any confusion or difficulty in navigating appears.
            A web designer would take this feedback and improve the site design as needed.
